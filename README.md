  To use PAW first you need to isntall the CERNlib package. If you're using Ubuntu-Linux than you can do it with the following code:
  
    $ sudo apt-get install cernlib*
   
  Once you installed it, type on the terminal:
  
    $ paw

  and click (Enter). Then, to create the figure use the following line:
  
    exe FILE_NAME.kumac
    
  to save the figure in .eps extension:
  
    p/print FILE_NAME.eps
